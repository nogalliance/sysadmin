# About power and responsibility

The Global NOG Alliance (GNA) is a foundation to help Network Operator Groups (NOGs) with supporting their communities. As a
system administrator for GNA you have access to the systems that run the websites, event management systems, mailing lists and
more. With this great power come great responsibilities!

We don't want to descend into legal language, and considering the wide range of nationalities of our sysadmins it would
probably not be enforcable in court anyway. Therefore we just set a few basic guidelines and apply common sense.

## Rules

- Everything that you can reasonably consider confidential must be treated as such
- You get access to our systems so you can help the organisations that GNA supports
  - If an organisation is not yet supported by GNA put them in touch with the board!
  - But don't create services for them yet
- Stick to the procedures in the Wiki
  - We don't want to create a mess
  - Suggestions are always welcome so good ideas can be turned into procedures
- And follow the [code of conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)

# Communication

We use the following communication channels:

- The sysadmin@nogalliance.org mailing list
- The sysadmin channel at https://nogalliance.slack.com
- The GNA-Sysadmin Telegram group
